## Conclusions:
- Medium size (1000 - 2000) *Independent* schools with per student spending range less than $630 have ***performed comparatively*** better than *Government* schools. On an average total budget of *Government schools* were ***200% higher*** than the Independent schools with an average per student spending of *$643* whereas for Independent schools, it was approx. *$598*.
- The *variability* of both maths and readings scores for all years are within ***normal distribution range***, i.e., within 2Ïƒ, with ***z score ranging from -1.8 to 1.7***, on an average. Performance of female students were *slightly (1-2%)* better than their counterparts in *reading* and were similar in *maths*.
